# hello_world

Hi everyone,

I am a novice in programming. I started off with Matlab and R, which I am starting to get and am able to write usable scripts with. 
To be able to run better timed experiments I am looking for something that will show stimuli as I would like it, will time everything very precisely and record data like reaction times accurately. 
According to my online search so far it appears that I should learn a Python based application. 
If you have any recommendations, I would love to hear them. 
My research area is in applied cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience. 
Hence applications able to communicate with EEG, for example, would be useful. 
Thank you.
